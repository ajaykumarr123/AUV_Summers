# SMACH
SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior. At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build hierarchical state machines. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with maintainable and modular code.
Smach, which stands for "State Machine", is a powerful and scalable Python-based library for hierarchical state machines. The Smach library does not depend on ROS, and can be used in any Python project. The executive_smach stack however provides very nice integration with ROS, including smooth actionlib integration and a powerful Smach viewer to visualize and introspect state machines.
